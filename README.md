This code makes a simple calculator you can use right in your browser. It has a screen to show numbers and buttons for digits, decimal point, plus, minus, times, divide, clear, and equals. When you click a number, it shows up on the screen. Pressing an operator remembers the number and the operation you want. Then you enter another number and hit equals, and the calculator does the math and shows you the answer. If you press clear, it resets everything so you can start fresh. It handles all the basic math you'd expect and even tells you if you try to divide by zero.
